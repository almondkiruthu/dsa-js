# Introduction

This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In many problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

Given two intervals (`a` and `b`), there are six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

Understanding the above six cases will help in solving all interval-related problems. Let's dive into the first problem to understand the **Merge Interval** pattern.
